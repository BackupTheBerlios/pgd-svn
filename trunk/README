PGD README

Introduction
------------

PGD is the Python Graphical Debugger. It is essentially a PyGTK front-end to
the rpdb2 debugger (under GPL license).


Requirements
------------

You will require:

 * Python 2.4 (http://python.org/)
 * PyGTK 2.6 (http://pygtk.org/)
 * Kiwi (http://kiwi.async.br/)
 * Setuptools (http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/setuptools)
 * GTKSourceView and Python bindings


Installation
------------

(You may skip this step if you wish to run directly from source)

In the top-level pgd directory, issue::

    python setup.py install

(You may require superuser access)


Running
-------

Installed - Issue the command::
    
    pgd [scriptname]

From Source - Run the script::

    python run-pgd.py [scriptname]

(Where scriptname is the optional python script to launch and debug on
startup)


Bugs
----

We love bugs. Please report them with an email to aafshar@gmail.com (until we
deserve a real bug tracker).


Thanks
